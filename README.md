online sofc application!!

sofc -- student organization funding committee

an online application for student organization treasurers to piece by piece submit their application as opposed to the prior one whole application all at once
treasurers will be able to submit 1 event at a time and add individual costs to it
they will be able to go back to the event and add costs whenever so they don't need to finish it all at once

sofc members will be able to approve the applications submitted cost by cost 
this is a change from before where one person needed to read a whole application
having members approve on a cost by cost basis will minimize the room for error and makes reading applications less stressful because each cost should be straightforward in approving, commenting, requesting an appeal, or cutting

admin (student bursar or bursar's office) will be able to allocate all funding deadline budget via the application
will check that all costs and appeals have been reviewed so unlike before this will prevent applications from slipping through the cracks
